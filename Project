EXPERIMENT 1 Different waveform generation using Opamp.

Objective:

Understand and Verify the operation of astable multivibrator using operational amplifier.

Understand the various mathematical operation using Opamp

Applications:

Timing Oscillator or clock for digital circuits.

Square wave generator with different duty cycle.

Mathematical functions of Opamp used in control circuits.

Components required:

TL072BCP, Resistors and Capacitors.

Operation:

Astable Multivibrator

An astable multivibrator assembled using Opamp is shown in Fig 1. The positive terminal of the Opamp will be at // Vout. Initially due to large gain of Opamp the output will be at pm V net The capacitor C1 charges or discharges with respect to the voltage at the output of Opamp

beta = R_{1}/(R_{1} + R_{2})

If we assume the OPAMP output is Vir, then the capacitor charges till the voltage across the capacitor is beta ^ * V The instance capacitor voltage crosses beta^ * V tal_{s} the Output of the Opamp switches to \mathcal{V} int. This discharge the capacitor. Since the positive terminal is at beta ^ * V the discharges happen till the voltage at cap becomes -BVir. As the result the voltage across capacitor will vary from-BVur to beta^ * V zs*t_{e} the output of the Opamp will toggle between pm V rat .
